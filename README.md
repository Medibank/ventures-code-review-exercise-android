# Technical Interview - Code Review Exercise

Part of our engineering hiring process is a technical interview containing a live code review exercise. 

During the technical interview, you will be asked to review the code in this repository, as though it had been submitted as a PR.

## Instructions

You will be asked to load the project in Android Studio, share your screen, take us through the project and share your thoughts about it.

Please have the project loaded and ready to go in Android Studio at the start of the interview. 

This is a code review exercise, not a coding exercise, so please **do not edit** the code prior to the interview. You are encouraged to familiarise yourself with the code, however.

For context, the code in this respository was one candidate's response to a take-home coding challenge for a job application. [Click here to view the original requirements.](https://github.com/Medibank/coding-challenge-android/tree/21e563cf199cdc025194b1ca05e4ca61b3ce82d4)
